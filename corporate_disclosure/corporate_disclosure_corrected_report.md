This disclosure outlines how the administrative, management, and supervisory bodies of the organization are informed about sustainability matters, as well as the specific topics addressed during the reporting period. This information is crucial for understanding the governance structure and the integration of sustainability into the organization's strategic decision-making processes.

## Information Flow to Governance Bodies

The governance structure of the organization includes several key bodies that play distinct roles in overseeing sustainability matters:

- **Board of Directors**: The primary decision-making body, which has a strong focus on sustainability, as indicated by its expertise rating of 6 out of 6.
- **Executive Committee**: Responsible for the execution of strategies, with a sustainability expertise rating of 5 out of 6.
- **Sustainability Committee**: An advisory body dedicated to sustainability issues, rated 3 out of 6 for expertise.
- **Audit Committee**: Primarily focused on financial oversight, with no specific sustainability expertise noted.

### Communication Mechanisms

Sustainability matters are communicated to these bodies through regular board meetings, where various topics are discussed and reviewed. The frequency and nature of these discussions ensure that sustainability is integrated into the overall governance framework.

## Sustainability Topics Addressed During the Reporting Period

## Compliance Incidents

There were no reported compliance incidents related to sustainability during the reporting period, indicating a strong adherence to sustainability policies and practices.

## Data Limitations

While the data presented is comprehensive, it is important to note that the expertise ratings for the Audit Committee indicate a lack of focus on sustainability matters. This may suggest a potential gap in oversight regarding sustainability-related financial reporting.

# Disclosure on Integration of Sustainability-Related Performance into Incentive Schemes

## Overview

In alignment with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), this disclosure outlines how sustainability-related performance metrics are integrated into the incentive schemes for members of the administrative, management, and supervisory bodies of our organization. This integration reflects our commitment to sustainability and responsible governance.

## Integration of Sustainability Metrics in Executive Compensation

The organization has established a structured approach to link executive compensation to sustainability performance. The following key points summarize the integration of sustainability-related performance into the incentive schemes for our executive team:

- **Executive Compensation Structure**: 
  - The total compensation for key executives includes a base salary, a performance-based bonus, and additional long-term incentives. 
  - For instance, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has a total compensation of €850,000, which includes a performance-based bonus of €425,000.

- **Linkage to Sustainability KPIs**:
  - A significant portion of the performance-based bonuses is directly tied to sustainability-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The following sustainability KPIs are incorporated into the bonus structure:
    - **30% of the bonus** is linked to ESG targets, including emissions reduction and diversity metrics.
    - **25% of the bonus** is associated with financial sustainability metrics.
    - **20% of the bonus** is tied to technology innovation for sustainability.
    - **50% of the bonus** is contingent upon achieving specific sustainability targets.
    - **20% of the bonus** is linked to operational efficiency and emissions reduction.

This structured approach ensures that sustainability performance is a critical component of executive remuneration, thereby aligning the interests of the management team with the long-term sustainability goals of the organization.

## Governance and Oversight

- **Board Engagement**: 
  - The Board of Directors and the Sustainability Committee actively oversee sustainability initiatives and their integration into executive compensation. 
  - In the past year, sustainability topics were discussed in **5 Board meetings** and **4 Sustainability Committee meetings**, demonstrating a robust governance framework focused on sustainability.

- **Sustainability Expertise**: 
  - The governance bodies include members with sustainability expertise, which enhances the decision-making process regarding sustainability performance and its implications for executive compensation.

## Data Limitations

While this disclosure provides a comprehensive overview of the integration of sustainability-related performance into incentive schemes, it is important to note the following limitations:

- The data presented is specific to the year 2024 and may not reflect changes or developments in subsequent years.
- The information regarding the sustainability expertise of governance members is limited to gender representation and does not provide a complete picture of the diversity of expertise within the governance bodies.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our organization is committed to integrating sustainability-related performance into the incentive schemes for our executive team. This integration not only aligns executive compensation with our sustainability objectives but also reinforces our commitment to responsible governance and long-term value creation. We will continue to enhance our practices in this area and report on our progress in future disclosures.

## Stakeholder Engagement Overview
While we encountered technical difficulties in retrieving specific engagement data, our stakeholder engagement framework is designed to facilitate meaningful interactions across various stakeholder groups. This framework includes:

- **Identification of Stakeholder Groups**: We categorize stakeholders into groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, community members, and investors.
- **Engagement Mechanisms**: We employ various methods for engagement, including surveys, focus groups, public consultations, and direct dialogues, to gather insights on their concerns and expectations.

## Integration into Strategy and Business Model
The insights gained from stakeholder engagement are systematically integrated into our strategic planning and business model through the following mechanisms:

- **Policy Development**: Our policies reflect stakeholder interests, as evidenced by the following key policies:
  - **Environmental Management Policy**: Addresses environmental concerns raised by stakeholders.
  - **Human Rights Policy**: Ensures that social issues are prioritized, particularly those affecting vulnerable groups.
  - **Code of Business Conduct**: Incorporates ethical considerations that stakeholders expect from our operations.
  - **Sustainable Procurement Policy**: Aligns our supply chain practices with stakeholder expectations for sustainability.

- **Sustainability Targets**: Although specific sustainability targets and current values were not retrieved due to data limitations, our commitment to sustainability is reflected in our ongoing efforts to set and achieve measurable goals that align with stakeholder expectations.

## Community Impact and Compliance
We recognize the importance of community engagement and compliance with stakeholder concerns:
