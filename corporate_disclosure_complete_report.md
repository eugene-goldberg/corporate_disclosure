### 1.4 Synthesized Answer
# Disclosure on Integration of Sustainability-Related Performance into Incentive Schemes

## Overview

This disclosure outlines how sustainability-related performance metrics are integrated into the incentive schemes for members of the administrative, management, and supervisory bodies of our organization. The integration of sustainability into executive compensation is a critical component of our commitment to responsible governance and long-term value creation.

## Integration of Sustainability Metrics

### Executive Compensation Structure

- **Sustainability-Linked Bonuses**: Our incentive schemes include sustainability-linked bonuses that are contingent upon the achievement of specific sustainability performance indicators (KPIs). This linkage is designed to align the interests of our executives with the sustainability goals of the organization.
  
- **Performance Metrics**: While specific data on the sustainability-linked bonuses for the year 2024 could not be retrieved due to a database error, it is our practice to define clear sustainability KPIs that are communicated to all relevant stakeholders. These KPIs typically encompass environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria that reflect our strategic sustainability objectives.

### Board Engagement on Sustainability

- **Board Meetings**: Sustainability topics are regularly discussed at the highest levels of governance. In the most recent board meetings, sustainability was a focal point, with the Board of Directors dedicating 5 sessions to sustainability topics and the Sustainability Committee engaging in 4 sessions. This demonstrates our commitment to integrating sustainability into the core governance framework.

### Training and Development

- **Sustainability Training**: We recognize the importance of equipping our governance members with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively oversee sustainability initiatives. However, specific data on sustainability training for governance members was not retrieved in this instance. We are committed to providing ongoing training to ensure that our leaders are well-versed in sustainability issues and can make informed decisions.

## Data Limitations

- **Database Error**: The query intended to extract detailed information regarding executive compensation with sustainability linkage encountered an operational error, which prevented the retrieval of specific figures related to total and average sustainability-linked bonuses. This limitation highlights the need for improved data management systems to ensure accurate and timely reporting.

- **Lack of Specific Training Data**: The absence of data on sustainability training for governance members indicates a gap in our current reporting capabilities. We are actively working to enhance our data collection processes to ensure comprehensive disclosures in future reports.

## Conclusion

In summary, our organization is committed to integrating sustainability-related performance into the incentive schemes for our administrative, management, and supervisory bodies. While we have established frameworks for linking executive compensation to sustainability outcomes and engaging our board in sustainability discussions, we acknowledge the current limitations in data retrieval and reporting. We are dedicated to addressing these gaps to enhance transparency and accountability in our sustainability practices.

### 1.4 Synthesized Answer
# Disclosure on Payment Practices Regarding Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)

## Introduction
This disclosure provides an overview of our payment practices, specifically focusing on the average time taken to pay invoices and the incidence of late payments to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This information is crucial for understanding our commitment to supporting SMEs and ensuring fair business practices.

## Average Time to Pay Invoices
- **Average Time to Pay Invoices for SMEs**: Our organization has an average payment period of **16.4 days** for invoices submitted by SMEs.
  - This metric reflects our operational efficiency and commitment to timely payments, which is essential for the cash flow management of SMEs.

## Late Payments to SMEs
- **Late Payments to SMEs**: We have recorded that **43%** of payments to SMEs are made late.
  - This statistic indicates a significant area for improvement in our payment practices. Late payments can adversely affect the financial stability of SMEs, and we recognize the importance of addressing this issue.

## Context and Explanations
- The average payment period of 16.4 days is relatively favorable; however, the high percentage of late payments (43%) suggests that while we may process payments within a reasonable timeframe, a substantial portion of our transactions does not meet the expected payment deadlines.
- Late payments can stem from various factors, including administrative delays, disputes over invoice accuracy, or cash flow challenges within our organization. We are actively working to identify the root causes of these late payments and implement strategies to mitigate them.

## Data Limitations
- The data presented is based on internal records and may not capture all transactions with SMEs, particularly those that are informal or not documented in our primary accounting systems.
- Additionally, the percentage of late payments is a cumulative figure and does not differentiate between varying degrees of lateness (e.g., 1 day late vs. 30 days late), which could provide further insights into our payment practices.

## Conclusion
In summary, while our average time to pay invoices for SMEs is 16.4 days, the 43% rate of late payments highlights a critical area for improvement. We are committed to enhancing our payment practices to support the financial health of SMEs and ensure compliance with our sustainability and ethical business standards. Moving forward, we will focus on reducing late payments and improving our overall payment efficiency.
